# Plebian-OS installer artwork attribution

This notice applies to the artwork in this directory:

- `logo.svg`
- `logo.png`
- `splash.png`
- `banner.png`
- `banner-dark.png`

It also applies to the shared Ceratopsian-derived desktop treatment at
`../desktop/plebian-os.png`.

The installer remains Debian-based. Plebian-OS and its artwork are not endorsed
by Debian, the Debian Installer Team, or the upstream Ceratopsian artist.

## License selected for this derivative set

The files listed above are distributed under the **GNU General Public License,
version 2 or (at your option) any later version** (`GPL-2.0-or-later`). This
selects the GPL-2.0+ option offered by the Ceratopsian copyright holder and is
also compatible with the GPL-2+ terms recorded for the Debian `rootskel-gtk`
source used by the graphical-installer banner.

The upstream Ceratopsian work remains alternatively available from its
copyright holder under CC-BY-SA-4.0. That alternative upstream grant does not
change the GPL-2.0-or-later distribution choice for this Plebian-OS derivative
set.

Plebian-OS-specific tracing, layout, wordmark, and other human-authored edits
are offered under GPL-2.0-or-later to the extent copyright or related rights
apply. Model-assisted steps do not remove or replace the upstream notices and
license obligations below.

The complete GPL version 2 text is included in this repository at
[`../COPYING.GPL-2`](../COPYING.GPL-2).

## Debian 13 Ceratopsian source

The layered blue backgrounds in `splash.png`, `banner.png`, and
`banner-dark.png` derive from Debian 13's Ceratopsian installer artwork. The
standalone Plebian-OS angular-P mark is an original replacement identity; it
does not reproduce the Debian swirl.

The following upstream record is preserved verbatim from the local Debian
source metadata in
`research/debian13/images/references/source-metadata/ceratopsian.md`:

Organic forms inspired by Trixie's frill, with an obvious debt to
futurePrototype.

# Process
Paper and pencil, and then Inkscape.

## Debian Installer `rootskel-gtk` source

The graphical-installer banner lineage includes Debian `rootskel-gtk` 13.0.4,
as extracted from the pinned Debian 13.5 netinst source. The saved Debian
machine-readable copyright record says:

## Plebian-OS generation and editing record

The Plebian-OS identity was prepared on 2026-07-13 through a
reference-guided, model-assisted editing workflow:

1. The pinned Debian Ceratopsian splash and `rootskel-gtk` banner were edited
   to remove Debian's product mark and introduce an angular terminal-P concept.
2. A model-produced isolated-logo concept was retained. Its checkerboard was
   embedded pixels, not transparency, so the approved geometry was manually
   traced into the canonical `logo.svg`.
3. `logo.png` was rendered with real transparency from that canonical vector.
4. The banner and splash were edited again using the approved angular-P geek
   mark as a fixed reference, then deterministically resized and normalized to
   the Debian Installer runtime contracts.

The retained authoring record is outside the build tree under
`research/plebian-os/`. It includes the exact prompts, full model outputs,
selected intermediate images, normalization commands, review notes, and
SHA-256 values. The principal record is
`research/plebian-os/INSTALLER_IMAGE_REVIEW.md`; the corresponding prompt files
are:

```text
prompts/boot-b-terminal-p.prompt.txt
prompts/gtk-b-terminal-p.prompt.txt
prompts/logo-geek-angular-p.prompt.txt
prompts/banner-geek.prompt.txt
prompts/installer-splash-geek.prompt.txt
```

The retained record does not identify a model version, seed, or an exact
SVG-to-PNG renderer command. Consequently, the prompts are provenance records,
not a claim that model generation or every export is bit-for-bit reproducible.
Future artwork revisions must record those details when the tools expose them.
