# Plebian-OS desktop artwork

`plebian-os.png` is the approved 1920x1080 desktop treatment of the
Plebian-OS angular-P geek identity. It is tracked as a stable product asset;
Debian Installer does not consume it.

The wallpaper uses the same Ceratopsian-derived background and
GPL-2.0-or-later distribution choice documented in
[`../installer/ATTRIBUTION.md`](../installer/ATTRIBUTION.md). The complete GPL
version 2 text is included at [`../COPYING.GPL-2`](../COPYING.GPL-2).

Runtime contract:

```text
1920x1080, 8-bit RGB PNG, no alpha, non-interlaced
SHA-256: 60f63c37f054f7ffd061b47e09a3c22fbf595eec6f161c13e95344ca1a724778
```

Keep release versions out of the bitmap. The remaster installs it at:

```text
/usr/local/share/plebian-os/wallpapers/plebian-os.png
```

The provisioner writes that path only into Pleb's persisted desktop state:
`~/.local/gpu_terminal/pleb/data/desktop/.state.json`. External, builtin, and
`auto` Pleb desktop providers all receive that same `KILIX_DESKTOP_DIR`, using
the common `wall_image` and `wall_mode=stretch` contract. Provider-owned Kilix
and Kilix-95 data is deliberately untouched, so a standalone Kilix-95 session
keeps its XP wallpaper. The Pleb state is created atomically as the target user
only when no state file exists; reprovisioning never rewrites an existing state
or wallpaper choice. `plebian-os-update` deploys later asset
revisions inside the same rollback-safe OS-layer transaction and seeds absent
state only after that transaction commits. The ISO build records the exact
bytes as `PLEBIAN_OS_DESKTOP_WALLPAPER_SHA256` in
`/etc/plebian-os/build-info.env`.

The immutable v0.1.1 updater knows a fixed seven-file OS-layer manifest, so an
upgrade from v0.1.1 needs two `plebian-os-update` invocations: the first deploys
the new scripts, and the second uses their eleven-file manifest to install this
asset, its LightDM greeter override, the attribution, and GPL text, then seed a
new desktop. Do not substitute a bare
`sudo plebian-os-provision` between those runs because sudo does not preserve
the coordinated install settings. For configuration-preserving reprovisioning
orchestration, the provisioner has a defensive fallback that accepts the asset
only from the target user's clean, origin-checked Plebian-OS checkout, binds the
working file to the tracked `HEAD` blob, and still enforces the exact hash.
