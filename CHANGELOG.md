# Changelog

All notable changes to Plebian-OS — and its coordinated
pleb / kilix / kilix-95 release — are recorded here. The stack uses a single
shared version across all four repositories (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)).

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First coordinated, versioned release of the Plebian-OS stack.

### Added
- Shared `VERSION` (0.1.0) across plebian-os, pleb, kilix, and kilix-95, recorded
  into every image as `PLEBIAN_OS_VERSION` and reported by each component's
  version flag.
- `releases/0.1.0.env` release-pin manifest and `PLEBIAN_OS_RELEASE=<ver>` build
  plumbing, so a release image pins every moving component to its `v0.1.0` tag.
- OS-layer self-update: `plebian-os-update` now refreshes the deployed
  provisioner, dependency installer, and update helper from a pinned plebian-os
  checkout before updating pleb + kilix (`PLEBIAN_OS_REPO` / `PLEBIAN_OS_REF`).
- `PLEBIAN_OS_APT_SNAPSHOT` to pin the first-boot apt closure to a
  snapshot.debian.org timestamp, plus a recorded installed-package manifest
  (`/var/lib/plebian-os/packages.list`) for build provenance.
- Post-provision **acceptance verification** in the VM builder (`build_vm_image.py`
  / `acceptance-vm.sh`): after firstboot it checks the provisioned marker,
  Pleb xsession, `session.env`, LightDM default, kilix engine, and update helper
  over SSH (honoring an overridden `KILIX_DIR`); `--no-verify` skips it.
- kilix's **builtin desktop now honors `KILIX_DESKTOP_FLAVOR`** (95/xp) — palette,
  title-bar/taskbar gradients, and Start button — matching the external Kilix 95.
- The optional `uv` installer is now **pinnable and integrity-verified**
  (`PLEBIAN_OS_UV_VERSION` + `PLEBIAN_OS_UV_INSTALLER_SHA256`) instead of a blind
  `curl | sh`.

### Security / defaults
- The committed preseed **no longer ships an account password or ssh-server**: the
  builders inject a hashed password (the VM builder also re-adds ssh-server for its
  provisioning watch), and a plain installer prompts interactively — so the raw
  template is safe by default.
- `--kiosk` now enables pleb's **hard respawn** (`PLEB_RESPAWN`) and pins the
  user's remembered LightDM session to Pleb (`~/.dmrc` + AccountsService), so a
  stale remembered session can't override the seat default on the appliance.

### Fixed / hardened
- USB flasher (`make-usb.sh`, `build_usb_image.py`) now recognises the running
  root disk on btrfs/subvolume layouts — previously the `[subvol]` suffix on
  `findmnt` output defeated the root-disk refusal — and `--force` against a
  non-removable disk always requires typed confirmation even with `--yes`.
- Interactive-disk builds strip *all* `d-i partman*` directives, so the
  installer always prompts for the target disk regardless of which partitioning
  keys a preseed carries.
- The temporary provisioning sudoers grant is now removed on signals as well as
  normal exit, and cleared before every first-boot attempt.
- install-deps and the preseed share one Recommends policy
  (`--no-install-recommends` ↔ `pkgsel/install-recommends false`), so both
  provisioning paths install the same closure.
- The build-time test-credential guard fires on the weak repository password
  independently of the ssh-server task, and `build-info.env` records the full
  runtime configuration (`PLEBIAN_OS_KIOSK` / `USER` / `NOPASSWD_SUDO` /
  `INSTALL_UV` / `DESKTOP`) that was baked into the image.
